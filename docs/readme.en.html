	<h2 id="config">I. Required configuration</h2>
	
	<p>WAnewsletter requires <abbr title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> 
	version 4.1.0 and up, as well as either MySQL or PostgreSQL database managers.</p>
	
	<p>Some optional features might not be available depending on your server's 
	configuration and installed <abbr>PHP</abbr> libraries. By example, the 
	statistics module requires that the GD library is installed.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="quickinstall">II. Installation&#160;: Quick Start</h2>
	
	<p>WAnewsletter contains a very simple installation script, so that neophytes
	can quickly use the script.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li> Upload all files contained in the archive on your server or hosting account,
		using your favorite <abbr title="File Transfert Protocol">FTP</abbr> 
		client (retain the directory structure) </li>
		<li> Set writing permissions on the <samp>includes/</samp> and <samp>upload/</samp> 
		directories and on the <samp>config.inc.php</samp> files which is into the 
		<samp>includes/</samp> directory.</li>
		<li> Point your web browser to the <samp>setup/install.php</samp>
		file in its proper location and open it (eg: http://www.yourdomain.com/newsletter/setup/install.php
		if the script is installed in the <samp>newsletter/</samp> folder in the site's root) </li>
		<li> Fill out the displayed form and click on the validation button.</li>
		<li> Once the script is installed, remove writing permissions on the <samp>includes/</samp>
		directory and <samp>includes/config.inc.php</samp> file</li>
		<li> After installation, remove the <samp>setup/</samp> directory from your server 
		or hosting account in order to prevent from reinstallation.</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="install">III. Installation&#160;: Detailed explanations</h2>
	
	<p>To correctly install WAnewsletter, you first have to upload all of the script's 
	files to your server or <abbr title="File Transfert Protocol">FTP</abbr> account. All 
	files should be uploaded in <var>ASCII</var> mode, except for  graphics used by the 
	script which are located in the <samp>images/</samp> and <samp>templates/images/</samp> 
	folders. These graphics should be uploaded in binary mode.</p>
	
	<p>With your favorite <abbr>FTP</abbr> client, set writing permissions on the 
	<samp>upload/</samp>, <samp>tmp/</samp>, <samp>stats/</samp> and <samp>includes/</samp> 
	directories and on <samp>includes/config.inc.php</samp> file which is into <samp>includes/</samp> 
	directory.</p>
	
	<p><em>Explanations&#160;:</em> <br />
	<br />
	The <samp>upload/</samp> folder will contain the files which you might attach to your 
	outgoing messages. In order for the script to correctly put these files in the 
	<samp>upload/</samp> folder, it has to have writing permissions. The script offers the 
	option of having attached files located on a remote ftp server. In this case, 
	you can remove the <samp>upload/</samp> folder.</p>
	
	<p>About the <samp>tmp/</samp> folder, please read the corresponding section the script's FAQ.</p>
	
	<p>The <samp>stats/</samp> folder will hold the files used by the statistics module. This 
	folder is useless if the GD library is not available on your server or hosting account.</p>
	
	<p>During the installation, the script creates a configuration file and puts it in the 
	<samp>includes/</samp> folder. This folder must also have writing permissions, but only 
	during the installation phase&#8201;! Once the installation has completed, remove writing 
	permissions on the folder and on <samp>includes/config.inc.php</samp> file.</p>
	
	<p>Once all files are on the server, and proper writing permissions are set, using your favorite browser, 
	go to the location where this <samp>setup/install.php</samp> file is placed.</p>
	
	<p>You have now reached the installation form. Please take note that if you change the 
	language item before clicking the validation button, the same page will reload, but this 
	time in the chosen language.</p>
	
	<p>Most of the time, the database server's name will be <var>localhost</var>, but it 
	could be different. If you do not know your database server's name and/or the necessary 
	access parameters, contact your hosting service. (Note: the access password is not 
	necessay for the form validation phase, convenient for local tests).</p>
	
	<p>A table's prefix is also asked, in order to avoid possible conflicts with other 
	already existing tables that might have the same name as one of WAnewsletter's tables.</p>
	
	<p>You should the enter parameters for the administration of the script, since its 
	access is protected. You can later add other users with personnalized access rights. 
	Once the script is installed, remove writing permissions ont the <samp>includes/</samp> 
	folder et remove the <samp>setup/</samp> folder from your host.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="update2.2">IV. Updating from version 2.2.x</h2>
	
	<p>To update from version 2.2.x, download the new version and replace files from the 
	old version with those from the new one (keep the <samp>includes/config.inc.php</samp> file, 
	and any content located in the <samp>upload/</samp> and <samp>stats/</samp> folders). 
	Point your web browser to the <samp>setup/install.php</samp> file in its proper location and 
	open it. Fill in your administrator username and password and let the script finish 
	the installation.</p>
	
	<p>Once the installation is done, remove the <samp>setup/</samp> folder.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="update2.0-1">V. Updating from 2.1.x or 2.0.x</h2>
	
	<p>To update from version 2.0.x or 2.1.x, download the new version and replace 
	files from the old version with those from the new one (keep the <samp>includes/config.inc.php</samp> 
	file, and any content located in the <samp>upload/</samp> and <samp>stats/</samp> folders).
	It is strongly advisable to make a backup of your script's database tables before 
	proceeding with the update&#8201;!</p>
	
	<p>Set writing permissions to the <samp>includes/</samp> folder for the time you 
	proceed with the update. Point your web browser to the <samp>setup/update.php</samp> file 
	in its proper location and open it. Fill in your administrator username and password 
	and let the script finish the update procedure.</p>
	
	<p>Once the update procedure is done remove the <samp>setup/</samp> folder, and remove 
	the writing permissions from the <samp>includes/</samp> folder.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="upgrade1.1">VI. Updating from version 1.1</h2>
	
	<p>There is no update script from version 1.1 supplied with versions 2.2.x and up. 
	The only way to work around this problem is to first update from version 1.1 to 
	version 2.1.x, and then from 2.1.x to 2.2.x.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bloc">
	<h2 id="problem">VII. Hosts causing problems</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li> On Free.fr, The total of emails that you can send is of 1000 by week </li>
		<li> On multimania/lycos, outgoing emails (in number of recipients) are limited of 150 a day</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If safe mode is activated on your server, the script needs a few minor adjustments.
	Please refer to the <a href="./faq.en.html#8" hreflang="en" 
	title="Script's temporary folder, safe mode and open_basedir">script's FAQ</a>.</p>
